The idea is \nto repeat the games sequence of colors which adds up by one for every successful turn.\nIt was important that the games graphics remained responsive to different screen sizes\nand that the turns moved seemlessly between the game and the user. \n \nWhile still resembling the original game, it looks and functions much better. \nWhy not try to beat your high score here: https://bandyp.github.io/simon/\n\n![](https://github.com/bandyp/simon/blob/master/assets/images/image.png)\n\n## UX\nI wanted to make it visually clean and tidy. White background to contrast with \nthe bright colours.\n\nThere is a short story in \nthe instructions and the game then makes it easy to try to break their own record.\n\nIt's fully responsive on all screen sizes.\n\nThis project started its journey in a balsamiq wireframe \n[here.](https://github.com/bandyp/simon/blob/master/assets/images/SimonMockUp.pdf)\n\nThis then evolved over time. Instead of the control panel in the centre it \nwas moved to the top, then removed altogether. It ended up taking too much room \non the page and didn't add to the look and feel of the game. \n\n## Features\n* Instructions: Playing the game is quite simple and \nrequires little guidance. But I like the idea of adding the element of helping \nSimon reach his goal.\n\n* High Score: The user can keep track of their best effort in a session.\n\n* Audio/Visual: The buttons light up and sound plays when the user clicks the \ncoloured buttons. There is a slight gradient on the coloured buttons to give a 3D effect.\nButtons respond visually to clicks. \n\n* In future, I might plan to have more difficult settings with 6 or 8 coloured buttons. Also, I feel the sounds could be improved open to sound more musical.\n\n* BUG - The help button has an issue on firefox, which could not be fixed from searches online.\n\n## Technology Used\n* HTML - for the sytructure of the content of the page\n* CSS3 - for designing the style of the the simon game\n* Javascript - for the gzame logic\n* Jquery - for moving around the DOM, simplifying the script\n* Jasmine - for testing that the player could not interupt the sequence accidently\n* Balsamiq for the wireframe\n* Bootstrap, originally, I really didn't make much use of the it. But once the script \nwas complete, I went back and fixed the HTML to be a lot more\nresponsive with bootstrap. Changing the round circle into 2 rows worked much better.\n* Google fonts - I tried to keep the buttons font a little retro and the score boxes\na digital feel. \n\n\n## Testing\n\n### Manual Tests\nI found the JS/Jquery part quite challenging. I started with writing out the \nlogic in simple steps [here.](https://github.com/bandyp/simon/blob/master/logic.md)\nBut even this needed to be simplified at each function. I would write a slightly \ncomplicated function and it would fail. \nI ended up making it simpler and testing it (usually with a console log) to see \nif it worked. \n\nThere was a lot of manual testing to ensure that the random sequence was \ngenerated, that the buttons corresponded to colours and sounds when clicked, \nthat the functions worked to check the arrays etc.\n\nFinally, I had friends and relatives use the app on their own devices and \nupdates were made to fix the issue of timings.\n### Automated Tests\n* Jasmine - used to test that the JS was working correctly when the player shouldn't be able to play\n* Chrome Developer Tools - to ensure all screen sizes responded correctly\n* W3C HTML & CSS Validation - used to test HTML and CSS\n* JSHint - used to test Javascript\n\n\n## Deployment\nI used Github for the deployment. I tried to keep to committing after each bit \nof functionality was added. Through the different versions it's possible to see \nhow the game evolved over time. Follow the link to the github depository to see \nthe version updates. https://github.com/bandyp/simon\n\n## Credits\n\n### Acknowledgments\nI started by looking at other games tutorials and following along. Until I \nreached a point where I could write my own code. At certain points I sought the \nhelp of the code institute tutors, stack overflow and youtube.\n* Mentor - thank you to Seun for helping with the code for the high score function.\n* Tutors - always a great help to point you in the right direction. Particularly on binding clicks and touches to the same function\n* Stack overflow - to get the power button to toggle on and off I borrowed a particularly useful bit of code from here. It adds (or removes) a class when clicked then combines an if statement. Also, adding in [0] after the sound is called to make it play.\n* Memory game - my first bit of research before I started was from this [site.](https://marina-ferreira.github.io/memory-game/) It was here I took a bit of code to generate random numbers as well as being good practise for my own game.\n* Other versions of simon - I also looked to this [sight](https://github.com/beaucarnes/simon-game) to help adjust my own code a little where I needed to compare the arrays.\n* W3Schools - I got some of my own help for the help button.\n* Simon icon in title is from a website called iconfinder.\n* Simon the original game was developed by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison with the coding by Lenny Cope.\n\n\n### Media\nSounds I copied from free code camp tutorial from the same [link]((https://github.com/beaucarnes/simon-game) above.\n","undoManager":{"mark":-2,"position":10,"stack":[[{"start":{"row":76,"column":55},"end":{"row":77,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["",""],"id":2},{"start":{"row":77,"column":0},"end":{"row":77,"column":2},"action":"insert","lines":["* "]}],[{"start":{"row":77,"column":2},"end":{"row":77,"column":3},"action":"insert","lines":["J"],"id":3},{"start":{"row":77,"column":3},"end":{"row":77,"column":4},"action":"insert","lines":["S"]}],[{"start":{"row":77,"column":4},"end":{"row":77,"column":5},"action":"insert","lines":["H"],"id":4},{"start":{"row":77,"column":5},"end":{"row":77,"column":6},"action":"insert","lines":["i"]},{"start":{"row":77,"column":6},"end":{"row":77,"column":7},"action":"insert","lines":["n"]},{"start":{"row":77,"column":7},"end":{"row":77,"column":8},"action":"insert","lines":["t"]}],[{"start":{"row":77,"column":8},"end":{"row":77,"column":9},"action":"insert","lines":[" "],"id":5},{"start":{"row":77,"column":9},"end":{"row":77,"column":10},"action":"insert","lines":["-"]}],[{"start":{"row":77,"column":10},"end":{"row":77,"column":11},"action":"insert","lines":[" "],"id":6},{"start":{"row":77,"column":11},"end":{"row":77,"column":12},"action":"insert","lines":["u"]},{"start":{"row":77,"column":12},"end":{"row":77,"column":13},"action":"insert","lines":["s"]},{"start":{"row":77,"column":13},"end":{"row":77,"column":14},"action":"insert","lines":["e"]}],[{"start":{"row":77,"column":14},"end":{"row":77,"column":15},"action":"insert","lines":["d"],"id":7}],[{"start":{"row":77,"column":15},"end":{"row":77,"column":16},"action":"insert","lines":[" "],"id":8},{"start":{"row":77,"column":16},"end":{"row":77,"column":17},"action":"insert","lines":["t"]},{"start":{"row":77,"column":17},"end":{"row":77,"column":18},"action":"insert","lines":["o"]}],[{"start":{"row":77,"column":18},"end":{"row":77,"column":19},"action":"insert","lines":[" "],"id":9},{"start":{"row":77,"column":19},"end":{"row":77,"column":20},"action":"insert","lines":["t"]},{"start":{"row":77,"column":20},"end":{"row":77,"column":21},"action":"insert","lines":["e"]},{"start":{"row":77,"column":21},"end":{"row":77,"column":22},"action":"insert","lines":["s"]},{"start":{"row":77,"column":22},"end":{"row":77,"column":23},"action":"insert","lines":["t"]}],[{"start":{"row":77,"column":23},"end":{"row":77,"column":24},"action":"insert","lines":[" "],"id":10}],[{"start":{"row":77,"column":24},"end":{"row":77,"column":25},"action":"insert","lines":["J"],"id":11},{"start":{"row":77,"column":25},"end":{"row":77,"column":26},"action":"insert","lines":["a"]}],[{"start":{"row":77,"column":24},"end":{"row":77,"column":26},"action":"remove","lines":["Ja"],"id":12},{"start":{"row":77,"column":24},"end":{"row":77,"column":34},"action":"insert","lines":["Javascript"]}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":900,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":77,"column":34},"end":{"row":77,"column":34},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":{"row":248,"mode":"ace/mode/markdown"}},"timestamp":1564593024044}
