Simon Says
*****
I really wanted to test myself with the javascript and jquery for this project. 
I planned to keep the design close to the original look, but then realised a cleaner layout looked much better. 
While still resembling the original game, it looks and functions much better. 

UX
*****
I wanted to make it visually clean and tidy. White background to contrast with the bright colours.

The idea is the user is playing this game for fun. There is a short story in the instructions and the game then makes it easy to try to break their record.

It's fully responsive on all screen sizes.

This project started its journey in a balsamiq wireframe attached. 

This then evolved over time. Instead of the control panel in the center it was moved to the top, then removed altogether. It ended up taking too much room on the page and didn't add to the look and fell of the game. 

Features
****
Intructions: I wanted to keep this fun. Playng the game is quite simple and requires little guidance. But I like the idea of adding the element of helping Simon reach his goal.

High Score: The user can keep track of their best effort.

Audio/Visual: The buttons light up and sound plays when the user clicks the coloured buttons.


Technology Used
****
Balsamiq for the wireframe.

Jquery for alot of the script.

Bootstrap, orinally I really didn't make much use of the it. But once the script was complete I went back and fixed the HTML to be alot more
responsive with bootstrap. Changing the round circle into 2 rows worked much better.

Google fonts - I tried to keep the buttons font a little retro and the score boxes a digital feel. 


Testing
****
I found the JS/Jquery part quite challenging. I stated with writing out the logic in simple steps. 
But even this needed to be simplified at each function. I would write a slightly complicated function and it would fail. 
I ended up making it simpler and testing it (usually with a console log) to see if it worked. 

There was alot of manual testing to ensure that the random sequence was generated, that the buttons coresponded to colors and sounds when clicked, that the functions worked to check the arrays etc.


Deployment
****
I used Github for the deployment. I tried to keep to commiting after each bit of functionality was added. Through the different versions its possible to see how the game evolved over time.

Credits
****
I started by looking at other games tutorials and following along. Until I reached a popint where I could write my own code. At certain points I sought the help of the code institute tutors, stack overflow and youtube.
